This model reproduces figures 1 and 2. On launch it simulates fig 2b.
Note that the myelin locations for voltage plots for fig 2b differ from the
paper by half a segment length. That is, in the paper the locations are at
x=.1, .2, .3, ..., .9 whereas in this simulation the centers of the 10 myelin
segments are at x = .05, .15, .25, ..., .95

The NEURON implementation of this model was prepared by Michael Hines.
Questions about details of this implementation should be addressed to him
at michael.hines@yale.edu.
