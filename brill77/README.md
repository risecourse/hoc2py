## Download and install

One group member should fork / clone the hoc2py repository, choosing *for your own purposes*. Switch to the brill77 branch. Push to Github. Remainder of group should fork from the group member repository, choosing to combine to the group member version.

Once cloned onto your computer, assuming you have installed the standalone NEURON version (and so have the neuron module available in python), now run the file `python main.py` and pick a figure to create. Think of main.py as similar to mosinit.hoc in the original code version.

You are also welcome to directly execute a figure python file, such as `python fig1.py` . 

You can run the above commands in a terminal like Anaconda Prompt (or Mac's Terminal). To work within Spyder, you would open the file, ensure the working directory points to the folder in which the file is saved, and click the green triangle to run the file.
